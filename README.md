# Heart Disease Prediction – Notebook

This repository contains a Google Colab–style notebook that demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for heart disease prediction using Logistic Regression.

## Project Overview
The notebook covers:
- Data loading and cleaning
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features
- Building a leakage-safe machine learning pipeline
- Model training and evaluation
- Confusion matrix and classification report analysis
- Exporting the trained model using joblib

## Dataset
The project uses the UCI Heart Disease dataset.

## Model
- Logistic Regression (binary classification: heart disease vs no heart disease)

## Files
- `Heart_Disease_Prediction_Final.ipynb` – Main notebook
- `logistic_regression_model.joblib` – Exported trained model

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells from top to bottom.
